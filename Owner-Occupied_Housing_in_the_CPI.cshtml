                        In 2013, the UK Office for National Statistics &#40;ONS&#41; launched the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers housing costs (CPIH). The CPIH is published alongside the ONS Consumer Prices Index, with the only notable difference 
                        being the inclusion of owner occupier housing costs &#40;OOH&#41;. This presentation will detail the development of CPIH, the analysis and user consultation that led to the choice of rental equivalence as the preferred measure of 
                        OOH and the methodology used.

                        In the Canadian CPI, the treatment of owned accommodation is designed to measure the impact of price changes on the costs of owning 
                        and maintaining a home. It captures the prices of owned shelter services by applying a partial user cost approach, which is more aligned with a cost-of-living concept. The presentation will explore 
                        recent trends in the Canadian housing market, as well as the data sources and methods used to measure the different components of owned accommodation. Research on the impact of using other approaches, 
                        practical limitations, and communications challenges will also be discussed. The user perspective will be covered by an evaluation of the various approaches for measuring owned accommodation by the Bank 
                        of Canada, including areas for further exploration.

                           This presentation will cover the history of OOH treatment in the U.S. CPI, and it will contrast the current REQ approach with research into alternative methods like the Payments approach.
